/**
 * 1. Problem 
 * Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return 
 * the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
 *
 * The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
 *
 * You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
 *
 * 2. Examples
 * Example 1:
 * Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
 * Output: [[-2,2]]
 * Explanation:
 * The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
 * The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
 * Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
 * We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
 * Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
 * Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
 *
 * 3. Constraints:
 * 1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
 * -104 < xi, yi < 104

  /**
   * 1. Approach
   * Modified Binary Search. This problem is equals to find the minimum target value V such that there are exactly
   * k elements smaller or equals to V, it gives inspiration on binary search. However, the pure binary search method 
   * will have time complexity as O(NlogN) which is no better than the sorting and priority queue approach.
   * 
   * An optimized approach is to narrow down the points array search range along with binary search. For each iteration,
   * we could separate the points into two list, closer (if element is smaller or equals to target value) or farther (if
   * element is larger than target value). If the size of closer is greater than k, then it means all elements in 
   * farther won't be in the final result, throw them away. If the size is less than k, then it means all elements 
   * within closer will be in the final result, add them all into the result.
   * 
   * 2. Complexity 
   * - Time O(N): N + N/2 + N/4 + .... + N/N < 2N
   * - Space O(N)
   * 
   * 3. Improvement
   * - Precalculate the distance to avoid recalculation => time improvement
   * - Don't forget update boundary of the binary search even though it is not used as much as in other BS
