# Recursion 

## Principle of Recursion 
Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine. By that, it reduces the given problem into subproblems until it reaches a point where the subproblem can be solved without further recursion.

**Highlights**
- Base Case(s) => Termination scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer
- Recurrence relation that reduces all other cases towards the base case
