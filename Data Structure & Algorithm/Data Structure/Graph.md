# Graph 
Disjoint Sets will be covered by a separate primer.

## Types 
1. Undirected Graphs
The edges between two vertices in this graph do not have a direction, indicating a two-way relationship.
2. Directed Graphs
The edges between two vertices in this graph are directional.
3. Weighted Graphs 
Each edge in a “weighted graph” has an associated weight. The weight can be of any metric, such as time, distance, size, etc.

## Graph Terminology 
1. Vertex 
2. Edge: connection between two vetices 
3. Path: sequence of vertices to go through from one vertex to another
4. Path Length: number of edges in a path
5. Cycle: a path where the starting and ending point is the same vertex 
6. Negative Weight Cycle: in weighted graphs if the sum of weight in a cycle is negative 
7. Connectivity: two vertices are connected if there exist at least one path between two vertices
8. Degree of a Vertex: the term “degree” applies to undirected graphs. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connecting the vertex. 
9. In-Degree: “in-degree” is a concept in directed graphs. If the in-degree of a vertex is d, there are d directional edges incident to the vertex. 
10. Out-Degree: “out-degree” is a concept in directed graphs. If the out-degree of a vertex is d, there are d edges incident from the vertex.
